# KaliSurface
A collection of the work I've done on getting Kali to work well with SP3,SP4,SB


First off, let me apologize for my poor structuring of this Repo.
I'm currently in the infancy of learning Git, as well as proper management of the Repo.
However, I think some of the work I've done others can benefit from and this seems to be the de facto method of sharing that work.

Initially, this repo will be divided into a couple of folders

## UsbInstallerFixes
This folder will contain the changes made to the original Kali USB installer to make UEFI boots work a little bit easier.

## KernelPatches
This is mainly going to be patches that are already available for Ubuntu, but slightly edited to work properly with Kali.

## Grub2Hacks
Since I haven't figured out exactly how everything is working in a normal UEFI boot with Grub and why things seemed to be F*d initially, I will describe my changes that made my instance of Kali work in a hacked-together fashion.

Once I have done more research into everything and learned some of the finer details of UEFI, GRUB2, and the Kernel I'm sure the folder structuring and available items will change.

In the meantime, good luck!
